# MachineLearning
Machine Learning exercises study year 19-20

# For reports in general
- read remarks on Bert's site
- explain your choices
- figures are very important!
- caption needs to be (somewhat) standalone
- correct and concise -> more points
- wishy-washy -> less points
- your results need to be reproducible based on the report
- code needs to run!
    - maybe use run_me.py, otherwise max 5/10.
