# MachineLearning
Machine Learning exercises study year 19-20. Please read this in order to run the files properly, and make sure
everything runs smoothly and we don't get graded a 0!

# Structure
The structure of this project is as follows: we have some smaller exercises in the root of this project, and the larger
exercises have their designated folder, e.g. mcmc has the folder week_2. In each folder of the larger exercises, a
run file is included, e.g. for mcmc there is week_2/run_mcmc.py. These can be run individually, but for ease of access 
we include a \_\_main__.py.

It is adviced to run this \_\_main__.py, because this adds the current working directory to the PATH, which prevents any
errors when importing scripts from other folders. Uncomment the file that you want to run, the comments should point you
in the right direction. Thank you.

#TL;DR
head in to \_\_main__.py and uncomment the line for the file you want to run. Each file is for one of the larger
exercises. Run the file however you like, we tested it in the command line using:

python3 \_\_main__.py
